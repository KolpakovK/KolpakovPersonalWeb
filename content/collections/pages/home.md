    title: '1. Briefing'
    content: |-
      We start our work with an acquaintance. We discuss the goals and objectives of your project, ways to achieve them. I introduc–µ you to my plan and the speed of work. This stage is the perfect time to talk about important details and nuances.
      <br><br>
      The result of the briefing is the specification, which describes the timing, cost, scope of work, and criteria. Based on them, you and I understand that the work is done.

    title: '2. Research'
    content: |-
      My favorite stage and the key to a successful project. Here I analyze the competitive environment and market of your product. I also conduct a visual analysis of the direction of your business, find dependencies and patterns used in the design.
      <br><br>
      The outcome of my research is competitive and visual analysis. It is impossible to create a structured design without this data. My conclusions form the basis of a prototype and are the starting point for the design of the future site.

    content: |-
      Next, I develop a description and a schematic representation of the future project. At this stage, I think over the structure of the site and the functionality of each page separately, based on the findings of the previous research.
      <br><br>
      In the resulting prototype of the site, all content is laid out in blocks and pages. Thereby body, structure, and logic of the future site are templated.

    title: '4. Design concept'
    content: |-
      The most colorful stage. I conduct a selection of references, compose a mood board based on your preferences and the results of visual analysis of competitors, create a design concept for all pages and blocks in Figma.
      <br><br>
      I prepare a Figma file with a fully developed project, including adaptive versions, for transferring to your developer. Also I can propose you to create your design with using Statamic CMS.
